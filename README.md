### What I Learned

1. Building real-world front-end projects using HTML and CSS, with a strong focus on clean structure and modern design principles.
2. Creating responsive designs that work smoothly across different screen sizes and devices.
3. Using Git and GitHub for version control and managing projects efficiently.
4. Working with the command line to improve development speed and workflow.
5. Writing clear and organized documentation using Markdown.
6. Learning by asking “why”, “how”, and “what happens if”, which helped me deeply understand concepts instead of memorizing solutions.
7. Completing 9 projects, including 7 Frontend Mentor challenges, to strengthen layout, responsiveness, and problem-solving skills.
8. Coding consistently every day for around 8 hours, experimenting, debugging, and continuously improving my development process.

### Future Plans

1. Learning Tailwind CSS to build unique and flexible designs without relying on predefined components, allowing for more creative and custom layouts.
2. Using Sass to write cleaner, more organized, and scalable CSS, making the styling process faster and easier to maintain.
3. Continuously practicing and building more projects to strengthen design implementation and problem-solving skills.
4. Starting JavaScript to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages.
5. Exploring JavaScript libraries after building a solid foundation in core JavaScript concepts.
